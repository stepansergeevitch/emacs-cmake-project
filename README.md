Emacs CMake project mode
==========

This is a fork of a [cmake-project](https://github.com/alamaison/emacs-cmake-project).

Improvements
----------
	Added `cmake-project-compile-function` command, which allows you to specify a CMake target when building.
	It remembers last built target and sets it as a default for next calls. It also has autocompletion implemented, with all available CMake targets
